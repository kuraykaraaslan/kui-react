# IoT 04: RPC console

**Goal:** send commands to a device and see what happened to them: one-way and two-way RPC, persistent (queued) RPC for offline devices, live status, response viewer and history.
**Effort:** M.
**Depends on:** 00, 01; 9.10 (`SchemaForm` for declared parameters), 9.11.
**Demo routes:** `/theme/iot/devices/[slug]?tab=rpc` · `/theme/iot/rpc` (fleet-wide RPC log).
**NB consumer:** `docs/new-iot-platform/iot_rpc/` (one-way/two-way RPC, persistent queue, timeouts, RPC console).

## Adapter methods added

`rpc.methods(deviceId)` (methods declared by the profile, with optional parameter schema and description), `rpc.send(deviceId, { method, params, oneway, timeoutMs, persistent, expirationTs? })`, `rpc.list(query)` (per device or fleet), `rpc.get(id)`, `rpc.cancel(id)` (queued only). Live topic: `rpc(deviceId)`.

> **→ DECISION OD-25 / OD-26 / OD-33 (owner, 2026-10-04):** RPC travels on the default topics `v1/rpc/req/{id}` → `v1/rpc/res/{id}` (server → device) and `v1/rpc/up/req/{id}` → `v1/rpc/up/res/{id}` (device → server); no brand name in topics; `v1/` is reserved. ~~Devices on a "ThingsBoard compatible" profile use the ThingsBoard mapping profile's `v1/devices/me/rpc/request/{id}` / `…/response/{id}` instead.~~ The console is topic-agnostic (it calls `rpc.send`); the request detail drawer shows the topic the request went out on (from the adapter), ~~so an integrator can debug both transports~~. Downlink happens only on default topics, never on any-topic paths.
>
> **→ DECISION OD-85 (owner, 2026-10-04):** the ThingsBoard mapping supports **telemetry and attributes only** — no ThingsBoard RPC (narrows OD-26 / OD-43). RPC reaches only devices that use the default `v1/rpc/…` topics. For a device connected on the ThingsBoard scheme the console is shown disabled with "RPC is not available for devices on the ThingsBoard compatible scheme; use shared attributes (Attributes tab) to send settings", and the adapter answers `rpc.send` for such a device with `{ code: 'rpc_not_supported' }`.

## 4.1 Send panel

- [ ] `RpcSendPanel`: method combobox (declared methods first, free text allowed when the profile permits), parameters as `SchemaForm` (9.10) when the method declares a schema, otherwise a JSON `CodeEditor` with validation. **→ DECISION OD-16 (owner, 2026-10-04):** a declared parameter schema is `FieldSchema` (the single vocabulary, 9.10); a JSON Schema subset is accepted only through 9.10's `fromJsonSchema` adapter.
- [ ] One-way / two-way toggle, timeout, "persistent" (deliver when the device comes back) with expiration; the panel warns when the device is offline and persistent is off.
- [ ] Templates: saved method + params pairs per profile (for Roltek routers, for example `reboot`, `ping`, a `ubus` call) defined by the profile, never hard-coded in the component.
- [ ] Respects `canSendRpc`; destructive methods flagged by the profile (`reboot`, ~~`factory_reset`~~) need a `Popconfirm`.
  > **→ DECISION OD-8 (owner, 2026-10-04):** there is **no** remote factory-reset RPC; reboot and sysupgrade only. No template, preset, demo seed, showcase variant or confirmation list in kui-react contains `factory_reset` / `sys.factory_reset`; the destructive examples are `reboot` and the OTA-driven sysupgrade (phase 06, not a console RPC).
- [ ] (OD-8) Demo adapter: `rpc.methods` for the seeded Roltek router profile declares `reboot`, `ping` and a read-only `ubus` call, and no factory-reset method.
- [ ] (OD-85) `RpcSendPanel` disabled state for devices on the ThingsBoard compatible scheme (reason text above, link to the Attributes tab); the fleet log's "send" shortcut skips such devices; `rpc_not_supported` maps to the same text. The demo seeds one ThingsBoard-scheme device.
- [ ] (OD-80) The phase 07 control widgets (`iot.button`, `iot.switch`, `iot.slider`, `iot.setpoint` with an RPC target) send through the same `rpc.send` and appear in this request list with "sent by: dashboard <board> / widget <title>", so a control action is traceable here.

## 4.2 Request list and detail

- [ ] `RpcRequestList`: method, status, sent by, created, delivered, completed, duration; status from the live topic. Status set follows NB `iot_rpc` (ThingsBoard's persistent RPC states are the reference: queued, sent, delivered, successful, timeout, expired, failed).
- [ ] Row detail in a `Drawer`: request JSON, response JSON (two-way) with copy, error, the state transitions as a `Timeline`; "re-run" pre-fills the send panel; "cancel" for queued requests.
- [ ] Fleet log (`/theme/iot/rpc`): the same list across devices with device/method/status filters.

## 4.3 Demo behaviour

- [ ] The demo adapter answers declared methods with plausible responses after a delay, times out some on purpose, and queues requests for offline devices until the mock source brings them online.

## Showcase

New Domain entries: `RpcSendPanel`, `RpcRequestList`, `RpcRequestDetail`, `RpcConsoleView`.

## Definition of done

- In the demo: send a two-way call and read its response; send a persistent call to an offline device, see it queued, then delivered when the device comes online; a timed-out call shows its timeout state.
- (OD-8) No factory-reset method is offered anywhere in the console, its templates or the demo seed.
- (OD-85) The seeded ThingsBoard-scheme device shows the console disabled with the "not available" reason; no ThingsBoard RPC topic appears in any drawer, template or seed.
