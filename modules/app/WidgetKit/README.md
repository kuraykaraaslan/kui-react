# modules/app/WidgetKit

The dashboard widget kit: one card around every widget, versioned settings templates (ThingsBoard-depth
editing), a settings editor, the presentational view of every builtin widget type, and a board with
JSON export/import. Source of truth for next-boilerplate's dashboard (phase 21), which vendors this
directory into `modules/common/ui/kui/widget-kit/` with `scripts/kui/vendor-widgetkit.mjs`.

## Rules

1. **Free colour** (owner decision D-21.1): a colour setting is any CSS colour or a theme token
   (`var(--primary)`); defaults are tokens. Settings colours reach the DOM only through `cssColor()`.
2. **Versioned templates** (D-21.6): every template has an id and an integer version; stored settings
   carry `$v`; a change that is not purely additive bumps the version and appends a migration step.
   Steps are never deleted. Data from a newer version is shown read-only and never downgraded.
3. Pure files (`settings/*`, `templates/*`, `kind.ts`) import no React at runtime: next-boilerplate's
   server validates with them.
4. No stored code and no raw CSS in settings (the only ThingsBoard features not taken).

See [/AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md).

## Changing a template

| Change | Bump the version? | What else |
|---|---|---|
| Add a field (its default renders exactly as before), an option, or change a label/group/`advanced` | No | Give the field `since: <current version>` |
| Change a default, rename, retype, narrow a range, remove an option | Yes | Append a migration step (`ops` or `up`); never edit or delete an old step |
| Remove a field | Yes, twice | First `deprecated: { since, replacedBy?, removeIn }`, drop it at least one version later |

`tests/templates.lock.json` records every field at its version and fails a change that needed a bump.
After an intended bump, run `UPDATE_TEMPLATE_LOCK=1 npx vitest run modules/app/WidgetKit/tests/templates-lock.test.ts`:
it locks the new version and writes a golden fixture `tests/fixtures/<id>/v<N>.json` for it. Existing fixtures
are append-only, so settings saved by every past version keep migrating.
