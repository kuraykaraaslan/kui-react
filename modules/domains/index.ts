// Top-level domain barrel. Re-exports each vertical as a namespace so callers can do:
//
//   import { Commerce, Blog } from '@/modules/domains';
//   const card = <Commerce.ProductCard ... />;
//
// For a flat import, use the vertical's own barrel:
//
//   import { ProductCard } from '@/modules/domains/commerce';
