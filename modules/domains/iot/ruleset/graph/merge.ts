/**
 * Three-way merge of one flow (a chain with its groups and subflows): the flow as it was when it was
 * opened (`base`), as it is in the editor (`mine`) and as the host has it now (`theirs`).
 *
 * - A node, group or subflow only one side changed (or added, or deleted) is taken from that side.
 * - Changed on both sides in different ways: a conflict. It keeps the editor's version and is listed.
 * - Connections are a set, keyed by their ends: one removed or added by either side stays removed or added.
 *   A connection to a node that is gone goes with it.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no storage. Subflows are compared as a whole (a subflow edited on both sides is a conflict).
